**For Debugging üêû** Debugger runs at `5002`. Vs code configuration is at `.vscode/launch.json` which will attach
debugger to remote application.

## Running

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update according to requirement.
- ### using Docker
  - run `docker-compose up` (with default configuration will run at `5000` and adminer runs at `5001`)
- ### using Gin Watch
  - run `make run`

## External Services

> Run `go get <package name>` to install.

#### Firebase

- Package name: github.com/readytowork-org/go_firebase_service
- Github: https://github.com/readytowork-org/go_firebase_service

#### GCP

- Package name: github.com/readytowork-org/go_gcp_service
- Github: https://github.com/readytowork-org/go_gcp_service

## Swagger docs config

> Please refer to [SWAGGER.md](https://github.com/readytowork-org/go-gin-skeleton/blob/develop/SWAGGER.md)

## Run CLI üñ•

- Run `docker-compose exec web sh`
- After running type `./__debug_bin cli` you will start cli application.
- Choose the commands to run afterwards.
- To run `docker-compose up` ( with default configuration will run at 5000 and adminer runs at 5001)
- To run with setting up pre-commit hook `make start` ( with default configuration will run at 5000 and adminer runs at
  5001`)

## Implements Google Cloud Proxy by default

This reduces hassle for developer to update IP in Cloud SQL during IP Change.

Implemented through docker image as follows

- Cloud SQL -> Google Proxy Docker Image -> Web App

#### Points to remember for smooth working

- `ServiceAccountKey.json` requires Cloud SQL Read and Write Permission
- `DB_HOST_NAME` value in `.env` is required
- `DB_HOST=cloud-sql-proxy` instead of `IPV4` or `DB_HOST_NAME` for development environment
- `DB_PORT` will be `3306` by default

## For auto generate of CRUD(Create, ReaD, Update & Delete) api following informations are needed and will be asked in terminal:

- resource-name: name of CRUD in upper camelCase. examples:Food,Puppy,ProductCategory etc.

- resource-table-name: name of CRUD in lower snake case. examples:food,puppy,product_category etc.

- plural-resource-table-name: plural name for the table going to be created. example: foods, puppies,
  product_categories.

- plural-resource-name: plural name of CRUD in Upper camelCase. examples:Foods,Puppies,ProductCategories etc.
